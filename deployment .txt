Assume you are asked to get your code running in the cloud using AWS. 
What tools and AWS services would you use to deploy the API, database, and a scheduled version of your data ingestion code? 
Write up a description of your approach.

As I am currently working at Uber, Where I focus mainly on scability and real time performance. 
I would containerize the backend API with Docker and deploy each service using ECS with fargate for scability. 
I used to use EC2 before in place of fargate but with the help of fargate we donot have to manage the servers and then the images are stored in ECR 
and an incoming traffic would be routed through an application load balancer.

I would use RDS for transactional data for trips and payments and redies for real time data. All services would be deployed in a VPC for security.
For scheduled data like weather or traffic , I would use AWS Lambda with EventBridge and rawdata would go to S3 and I would use pyspark or Glue for processing.

Since Uber runs globally, I would also implement cloudwatch dashboards and alarms to monitor errors and scaling metrics in real time.
